# Desert Fern

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Gameplay

You are a fern searching for your cactus friend. Traverse the desert to save her.

### Controls

w - jump  
a - go backward  
s - duck  
d - go forward  
shift - run

Note that duck prevents using the other keys.

## Development

After cloning the repo, inside the directory, run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then
run `num run build` to build the bundle. (Note this will build and watch.) All the JavaScript and
HTML is client side, so you can open public/index.html in your favorite browser to view it.
